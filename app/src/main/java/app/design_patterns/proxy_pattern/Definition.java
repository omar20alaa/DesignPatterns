   /*

   In proxy pattern, a class represents functionality of another class.
   This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern.
   In proxy pattern, we create object having original object to interface its
    functionality to outer world.

    We are going to create an Image interface and concrete classes implementing
     the Image interface.
    ProxyImage is a a proxy class to reduce memory footprint of RealImage object loading.

    ProxyPatternDemo, our demo class, will use ProxyImage to get an Image object
     to load and display as it needs.
