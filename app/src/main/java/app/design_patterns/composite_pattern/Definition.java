   /*

   The composite pattern is meant to allow treating individual objects and compositions of objects,
   or “composites” in the same way. It can be viewed as a tree structure made up of types that inherit a base type,
   and it can represent a single part or a whole hierarchy of objects.

   Composite Pattern consists of following objects.

   Base Component - Base component is the interface for all objects in the composition,
   client program uses base component to work with the objects in the composition.
   It can be an interface or an abstract class with some methods common to all the objects.
   Leaf - Defines the behaviour for the elements in the composition.
    It is the building block for the composition and implements base component.
     It doesn’t have references to other Components.
    Composite - It consists of leaf elements and implements the operations in base component.
