            What is Design Patterns


          Design Patterns are models of code that solve classic problems.
          They are solutions to software design problems that you can find
          in a real-world application.
          A Design Pattern is not a code that is ready to be used in your application,
          but it is a model that you can use to solve a problem.

          Design patterns are language neutral, so they can be applied to any
          language that supports object-orientation.

         Why and when should we use Design Patterns?

         Design Patterns exists to help us, developers. They enable us to implement
         tried and tested solutions (that is also used by other developers) to known problems,
         this way saving time and effort during the implementation of the code. They also define
         common words to talk about specific problems, making it easier to communicate,
         for example, you could say “you can use a factory in this case”, and other developers will
         know what they need to do.

          Sometimes you do not need a design pattern, and this is good to keep in mind, we should
           just use it when it’s necessary.
          Each design pattern can be used for a specific situation, and that’s one of the reasons
           why it’s important to know about them,
          because you can have a problem that is a known problem in the software development
           world and already exists a good solution to solve it, by using a design pattern.
           This way you do not need to ‘reinvent the wheel’, you can just use something that
           already exists and works well. So the best way to know when you should use it or not,
           it’s to learn them and understand which problem each design pattern solve.

         Gang of Four (GoF)

         In the year of 1994, four developers, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and
         John Vlissides, also known as
         ‘Gang of Four’ (GoF), published the book ‘Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable
          Object-Oriented Software’, and they introduced the concept of patterns,
          introducing 23 patterns of design. Those patterns from Gang of Four (GoF),
          are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns, and they are
          categorized into three groups:

         Creational — Concern with the process of creation (construction) of objects.
         Structural — Deals with the composition of classes and objects.
         Behavioral — Characterize the ways in which classes or objects interact and
         distribute responsibility.
         The elements of a Design Pattern

         The book ‘Design Patterns’, says that a pattern has four essential elements:

          A name — that is used to describe a design problem, the solution and the consequences.
         The problem — that describes when we need to apply the pattern, explaining the problem
          and its context.
         The solution — that describes the elements that make up the design, the relationships,
          the responsibilities and collaborations.
         The solutions do not describe a concrete implementation, because a pattern is like a
         template which can be applied in many different situations,
         but provides an abstract description of a design problem and how a general arrangement of
         elements (classes and objects) solves it.
         The consequences — that are the results of applying the pattern.
